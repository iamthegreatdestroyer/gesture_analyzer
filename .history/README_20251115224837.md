# GestureAnalyzer

A personal desktop application to detect, analyze, and catalog hand gestures from local video files.

## Features
- Load local videos (MP4, AVI, etc.)
- Detect hands and landmarks with MediaPipe
- Analyze patterns (repetitions, simple motion sequences)
- Store results locally in SQLite
- Desktop UI via PyQt5
- Containerized with Docker Compose

## Quickstart (Windows PowerShell)
```powershell
# From the project root
python -m venv venv
./venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## Run Tests
```powershell
./venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
pytest -q
```

## Docker
GUI apps are not ideal in containers on Windows, but you can still build
and run the backend to verify dependencies and use headless processing.

```powershell
docker compose up --build
```

Data persists in `./data` (mounted into the container at `/app/data`).

## Project Structure
- `app.py` – PyQt5 GUI entrypoint
- `gesture_analyzer.py` – CV processing and pattern analysis
- `db.py` – SQLite catalog utilities
- `tests/` – pytest tests
- `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` – container setup
- `requirements.txt` – dependencies
